<!-- Legacy Create React App HTML template (DEPRECATED)
     This file was left-over from an earlier setup and is not used by Next.js.
     Public directory in this repository is used only for static assets (images, icons, etc.).
     Please do not add SPA entry files here — Next.js uses the `app/` router.
